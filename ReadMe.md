## 📖 Story

Long ago, the kingdom of **Aetherfall** was protected by an ancient order known as the **Guardians** — warriors blessed with supernatural strength to defend the realm from darkness. Among them stood the greatest warrior of all, a hero whose name was spoken with reverence across the lands.

But peace never lasts forever.

A forbidden ritual performed by a corrupted wizard unleashed a plague of darkness across the kingdom. The dead began to rise, monsters emerged from the shadows, and the sacred lands were consumed by chaos. In the final battle, the Guardians fell… all except one.

**You.**

Wounded and weakened, you awaken after years of silence to find the world overrun by undead creatures and powerful beasts serving a mysterious force.

As you journey forward, you encounter hordes of zombies and twisted creatures guarding the path to powerful bosses:

- 🧙 A corrupted **Dark Wizard**
- 🐺 A savage **Werewolf**
- 🐂 A brutal **Minotaur**
- 🔮 The **Supreme Sorcerer**, the mastermind behind the kingdom’s fall

Each victory restores a fragment of your lost power, transforming you into a stronger version of yourself — the true Guardian you once were.

The fate of the realm now rests in your hands.

Will you reclaim your strength and defeat the darkness…

Or will the world remain forever fallen?
